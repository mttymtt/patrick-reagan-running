    <p>Thankful for all the support from my sponsors</p>

<p>HOKA one one
Hoka One One is my main sponsor. I cover all miles of my training and racing in a wide array of neutral shoes in the line. My favorite Hoka One One shoes are the Clifton, Clayton, Bondi, Speedgoat, Challenger ATR, Tracer, and Speed Instinct. The Ora Slide is my favorite recovery footwear.</p>

<p>Drymax Sports
Drymax is a cutting edge sock company based in California. The socks have unique technology that keeps the feet dry, comfortable, and blister free in all conditions. Try the Max Protection Running and Hot Weather Running models.</p>

<p>Compressport
Compressport is a medical grade compression company based in Switzerland. I wear the R2 Calf Sleeves while training, racing, and recovering.</p>

<p>GU Energy
GU designs innovative nutrition products for before, during, and after competition. I use the Roctane Gels and Sportsdrink during training and racing. The new Stroopwaffel is a perfect pre-activity snack. The Blueberry Pomegranate Chews are my favorite solid food during activity.</p>

<p>Victory Sport Design
Victor Ballesteros’s California based company designs the highest quality travel and “drop” bags. The bags come in many sizes, designed to be used both on and off the race course. The Bear III and Grizzly pair very well as travel bags during air travel.</p>

<p>UltrAspire
UltrAspire has become my go to for hydration needs.</p>

<p>Squirrel’s Nut Butter
Squirrel’s Nut Butter is an all natural anti-chaffing skin salve that enables me to run in comfort.</p>

<p>Flora health
I’ve partnered with Flora Health for all my sports specific oils and fermented greens added to my diet. Udo’s Oil, Omega Sport+ Oil, and Green Blend are the products I use most frequently. The Flora Baobites are great pre/post run snacks.</p>

<p>Perc Coffee Roasters for the time in between training and racing. Roasted and brewed right here in Savannah by Philip Brown. I highly recommend their Ethopian roasts and if you can swing by their shop be sure to grab an espresso tonic.</p>
